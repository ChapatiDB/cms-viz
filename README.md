Map-based visualizations of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provider charge data.

See the visualization at http://labs.coseppi.com/cms

In 2013, the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](http://www.cms.gov/) (CMS) released [provider charge data](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/index.html) for the top 100 inpatient services and top 30 outpatient services for over 3000 Medicare providers across the United States.

This visualization groups providers by their [Hospital Referral Region](http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/data/region/), showing the average charge to Medicare, average payment from Medicare, and the % reduction from charge to payment for all of these health services.
